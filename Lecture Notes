CPSC 585 - Lecture 1

Machine Learning â€“ study of methods to develop a system that can learn.
Key is to acquire knowledge by finding patterns, relationships, or policies.
Learns from input data, including training data (with label), unlabeled data, experience data in an environment.

Workflow: data processing, modeling, deployment
0. Retrieve data
1. clean and explore
1. prepare/transform
2. develop and train model
2. validate/evaluate model
3. deploy to production
3. monitor and update model & data

data set without label is most common
training data set have labels

Rote learning - memorization and simple matching
Supervised learning (direct feedback, predict outcomes):
learning by examples in a training data set
learning f is called training.
if function f is used to predict continuous value y: this is regression
if classifier f is used to determine discrete value y: this is classification
classification tries to find the decision boundary that separates the different groups of data
regression tries to find the function that fits the data best.


unsupervised learning (no feedback):
clustering, finding associations or features in unlabeled data.
semi- or self-supervised learning - a mix of both

reinforcement learning (reward system) - learn rules or actions by trial-and-error to REINFORCE.
